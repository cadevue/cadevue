**`Cadevue | Software Engineer, Game and Web Development üëæüöÄ`**<br>

## About Me
A creative, passionate learner and software engineer specialized in video game and web development. I am currently studying at Bandung Institute of Technology and **will graduate soon** this year (2025). I've worked on multiple projects in a wide range of task during my CS studies, including video game, web development, graphics programming, AI/ML, desktop app, and even mobile app. 

All of that, which I currently compiles all of the projects gradually while curating, refining, even redoing some of them. This is part of [CS202 Journey](https://cadevue.com), a challenge which I took on myself to re-visit all of the subjects I've learnt during my 4 years study. Oh, I also write more about those and other things on [my website](https://cadevue.com), so please do check it out!

My activities lately has been:
- üåå Working on **Solar Odyssey**, an educational VR-game about solar system \w emphasis on rendering optimization (Thesis).
- üìö Doing **CS202**, a challenge I made for myself to revisit all of the computer science subjects and understand it at a deeper level.
- ‚úç  Writing articles about techs and my journey at [**cadevue.com**](https://cadevue.com)
- üòé Discovering myself!
